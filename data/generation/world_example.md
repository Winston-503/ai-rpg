In the mystical realm of Eldoria, the world is divided into three main regions: the verdant Kingdom of Loraith, the arid Desert of Zalthar, and the icy reaches of the Frostbound Plains. The Kingdom of Loraith is known for its lush forests and sprawling grasslands, where magic flows through the very air and is harnessed by its inhabitants, the Elara—the realm's premier spellcasters. Towering above the landscape is the Crystal Citadel, the seat of power for the High Council of Elders who oversee the kingdom. Loraith’s architecture is a blend of nature and enchantment, with buildings entwined with living vines that react to magical incantations.

Across the ocean of Sandsea lies the Desert of Zalthar, a land of resilient nomads and hidden mysteries. Here, the inhabitants, known as the Zalthari, are skilled warriors and traders, famed for their beautiful mosaics and deadly sand magic. They honor the ancient drake Yarrathek, believed to have created the desert with his fiery breath in a long-forgotten battle against the gods. The annual Festival of Flames is a significant cultural event where fiery displays mark the night skies, celebrating both creation and destruction.

To the north, beyond the Wall of Whispers, lies the Frostbound Plains, home to the resilient tribes of the Norrtak. This inhospitable terrain is blanketed in eternal snow and harsh winds, where survival requires ingenuity and strength. The Norrtak people venerate Cyndra, the eternal Ice Wolf, who is said to guard the Night's Heart—a mystical aurora that grants visions of the past and future. Legends speak of how the Night's Heart once united the lands against the dark sorcerer Malvikar, whose defeat ended the Age of Shadows and ushered in the current Era of Light, a time of tenuous peace and rediscovery.
